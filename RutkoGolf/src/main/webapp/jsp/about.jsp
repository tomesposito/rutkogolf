<h1>About</h1> 
<p>As a family, we suffered the loss of our mother to cancer four years ago. 
This was a painful loss and we want to fight back-so we are planning our second annual charity golf outing with all proceeds to benefit the American Cancer Society. 
The Second Annual Rutkowski Invitational Golf Outing will be held Saturday, October 8, 2011 at White Pines Golf Club in Bensenville, IL. 
Through our outing we are hoping to provide the American Cancer Society with badly needed support.</p> 
<p>The American Cancer Society is <i>the nationwide, community-based, voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer, 
saving lives, and diminishing suffering from cancer, through research, education, advocacy and service.</i> 
Together, with millions of supporters, <i>the American Cancer Society saves lives and creates a world with less cancer and more birthdays by helping people stay well, 
helping people get well, by finding cures and by fighting back.</i>  For more information on the American Cancer Society visit <a href="http://www.cancer.org" target="_blank">www.cancer.org</a>.</p> 
<p>The First Annual Rutkowski Invitational Golf Outing was held in October of 2010 at White Pines Golf Club, and our outing was a success. With the help of 95 attendees and our wonderful sponsors we were able to donate over $4,000 to the American Cancer Society. We are hoping to increase that donation this year!</p>
